# Mancala-Board-Game

## Description

This project presents an implementation of the classic Mancala Game, offering an engaging experience for two players. The game consists of a board with twelve pits, six for each player, and two large stores where each player collects their captured stones. Through a series of strategic moves, players aim to accumulate as many stones as possible in their respective stores.

The core of the game revolves around distributing stones from one pit to another, with the objective of capturing your opponent's stones. This project provides a comprehensive representation of the game, including the initialization of the board, stone distribution, capturing rules, and determining the winner.
